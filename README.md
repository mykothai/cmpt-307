# CMPT 307 Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains course work for CMPT 307.
Included is the implementation and analysis for:
- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort
- Random
- Random Search
- Cut Rod (dynamic programming)
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree 
  - Adjacency list
  - Adjacency matrix

### Prim's MST (A7)
Prims MST algorithms for adjacency lists and adjacency matrices are run on figure1 below first.

![Graph of figure 1](https://github.com/mykothai/cmpt-307-data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/A7/java%20code/img/figure-1.PNG?raw=true)

The two Prim's MST algorithms are then run on randomly generated connected edge-weighted graphs 
 - n = 100, 200, 400, 800 nodes and 
 - m = 3n, n^1.5, n(n âˆ’ 1)/2 edges
